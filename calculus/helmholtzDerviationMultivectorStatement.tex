If vector \(\BM\) is defined by its divergence

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:helmholtzDerviationMultivector:20}
\spacegrad \cdot \BM = s
\end{dmath}

and its curl
\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:helmholtzDerviationMultivector:40}
\spacegrad \cross \BM = \BC
\end{dmath}

within a region and its normal component \( \BM_{\txtn} \) over the boundary, then \( \BM \) is
uniquely specified.
