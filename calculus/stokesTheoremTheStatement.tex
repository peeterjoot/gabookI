\maketheorem{Stokes' Theorem}{thm:stokesTheoremGeometricAlgebra:1740}{

For blades \(F \in \bigwedge^{s}\), and \(m\) volume element \(d^k \Bx, s < k\),

\begin{equation*}%\label{eqn:stokesTheoremGeometricAlgebra:120}
\int_V d^k \Bx \cdot (\boldpartial \wedge F) = \int_{\partial V} d^{k-1} \Bx \cdot F.
\end{equation*}

Here the volume integral is over a \(m\) dimensional surface (manifold).  The derivative operator \(\boldpartial\) is called the vector derviative and is the projection of the gradient onto the tangent space of the manifold.  Integration over the boundary of \(V\) is indicated by \( \partial V \).
}

The vector derivative is defined by

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:stokesTheoremGeometricAlgebra:1400}
\boldpartial = \Bx^i \partial_i = \sum_i \Bx_i \PD{u^i}{}.
\end{equation}

where \( \Bx^i \) are reciprocal frame vectors dual to the tangent vector basis \( \Bx_i \) associated with the parameters \( u^1, u^2, \cdots \).  These will be defined in more detail in the next section.  Once the volume element, vector product and the other concepts are defined, the proof of
Stokes theorem is really just a statement that

\boxedEquation{eqn:stokesTheoremGeometricAlgebra:2840}{
\int_V d^k \Bx \cdot (\Bx^i \partial_i \wedge F) =
\int_V \lr{ d^k \Bx \cdot \Bx^i } \cdot \partial_i F.
}

This dot product expansion applies to any degree blade and volume element provided the degree of the blade is less than that of the volume element (i.e. \(s < k\)).  That magic follows directly from \cref{thm:stokesTheoremGeometricAlgebra:1420}.
