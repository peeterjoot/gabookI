Does anybody know of any applications to this moore penrose vector inverse in traditional matrix algebra?  As stated it's an interesting mathematical curiousity that yes one can define a vector inverse, however what would you do with it?

The subject of geometric algebra (a clifford algebra normally applied to real euclidian normed vector spaces) also has a vector inverse, and it has a fairly important place in that mathematics.  I noticed that the moore penrose "vector inverse" has a very similar form as this moore penrose vector inverse, and had initially added the following note:

 Note also that this is consistent with the [[Geometric_algebra | Geometric product]] vector inverse.

to this section since I thought it would put this "vector" inverse in a context where it would be more useful.  However I've removed it since I think this comment (and the section in general) needs some context to make it useful.  Its also not exactly true since the moore penrose vector inverse implies that its use is strictly in a dot product sense which isn't true for the GA vector inverse.

The geometric product vector inverse has the following form:

\[
a^{-1} = \frac{a}{a^2}
\]

(note above that the geometric product for a euclidian vector with itself is it's squared length.)

One place that there is "use" of the moore penrose vector inverse that I can see is in projection onto a line.  For example consider the following (GA) factorization of a vector into its projective and perpendicular (rejective) components:

\[
a = v \frac{1}{v} a = v \left( \frac{1}{v} \cdot a \right) + v \left( \frac{1}{v} \wedge a \right)
\]
\[
a = v \left( \frac{v}{v^2} \cdot a \right) + v \cdot \left( \frac{v}{v^2} \wedge a \right)
\]

This first part is the projection of a onto v, and in matrix notation one would write:


\[
Proj_v(a) = v \left( \frac{v^{\text{T}}}{v^{\text{T}} v} a \right) = v ( v^{+} a ) = (v v^{+}) a
\]

Unlike the GA vector inverse, whos associativity allowed for the projective derivation above, this MP vector inverse has only left action, so in the above, you can't further write:

\[
v v^{+} = 1
\]

(ie: $v v^{+}$ is a projection matrix not scalar unity).
