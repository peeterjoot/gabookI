[QUOTE=Hacky;1130706]But is there another geometrical (using cosine?) or intuitively logical reason why the inner product is defined this way?[/QUOTE]

One explaination for this and many other basic complex number properties, can be had, if one considers complex numbers to be a special representation of two dimensional vectors.

In a nutshell one can consider a complex number to be a vector with one of the unit vectors factored out, as in the following example:

[tex]
r = x e_1 + y e_2 = e_1 (x + e_1 e_2 y) e_1 = e_1 Z
[/tex]

(one could left or right factor out either of the [tex]e_j[/tex] unit vectors resulting in similar "complex number" representations).

Now that may look a bit strange at first since we are taught that we can't multiply or divide vectors, but these can be considered perfectly well defined operations with respect to the geometric (clifford) vector product.  In a nutshell, that product defines the square of a vector as a scalar with magnitude equal to its squared length.  A consequence of this rule, plus associativity and linearity, is the product of two perpendicular vectors is an entity that changes sign with commutation.  With these as rules for multiplication, squaring [tex]e_1 e_2[/tex] gives:

[tex]
(e_1 e_2)(e_1 e_2) = e_1 (e_2 e_1) e_2 = - e_1 e_1 e_2 e_2 = -1
[/tex]

ie: a product [tex]e_1 e_2[/tex] operates as a unit imaginary.  All the complex number operations (multiplication, conjgation, inversion, ...) have natural equivalents expressed in this fashion, including the inner product of your question.  I was quite excited seeing this for the first time since the complex multiplication "rule" (like the cross product "rule" also better formulated as a geometric product) always seemed like something that had been pulled out of a magic hat as opposed to something that followed from a logical argument.

Now, this probably doesn't precisely answer your question, instead should point you down a path that can, with some study, provide a good answer if you want it.  One possible starting place is lect1.pdf from the following:
