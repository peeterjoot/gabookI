Oops.  I see that what I was thinking of when I wrote even and odd isn't well described by those words.

Let me clarify what I meant by example, considering the product of two bivectors:

[tex]
AB = {\langle AB \rangle} + {\langle AB \rangle}_2 + {\langle AB \rangle}_4
[/tex]

By definition of dot and wedge product as the lowest and highest grade terms of a product respectively, this is:

[tex]
AB = A \cdot B + {\langle AB \rangle}_2 + A \wedge B 
[/tex]

One can show that:

[tex]
{\langle AB \rangle} = {\langle BA \rangle}
[/tex]
[tex]
{\langle AB \rangle}_4 = {\langle BA \rangle}_4
[/tex]

and also can show that:
[tex]
{\langle AB \rangle}_2 = -{\langle BA \rangle}_2
[/tex]

So, one can write the various grade terms of a bivector product in terms of symmetric and antisymetric sums like so:

[tex]
A \cdot B = \langle \frac{1}{2}\left(AB + BA\right) \rangle
[/tex]

[tex]
{\langle AB \rangle}_2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(AB - BA\right)
[/tex]

[tex]
A \wedge B = {\langle \frac{1}{2}\left(AB + BA\right) \rangle}_4
[/tex]


It's only with a restriction that one of the [tex] {\langle \rangle}_{0,4} [/tex] terms is zero that one can write the other 0 or 4 grade term strictly in using the symmetric sum of products (a good example of that is for intersecting planes, or any planes in [tex] \mathbb{R}^3 [/tex]).

So, when Geometric Algebra for Physicists, in equation (4.57) introduces the commutator product:

[tex]
A \times B = \frac{1}{2}\left(AB - BA\right)
[/tex]

One can see the utility of this in describing the geometry of planes.  As with an orthonormal decomposition of vectors into projective and rejective components:

[tex]
a = a \cdot b \frac{1}{b} + a \wedge b \frac{1}{b}
[/tex]

For bivectors that intersect ([tex]A \wedge B = 0[/tex]), one has
[tex]
A = A \cdot B \frac{1}{B} + A \times B \frac{1}{B}
[/tex]

Notationally, I think this is simpler looking than mixed use of the grade operator and the dot product:
[tex]
A = A \cdot B \frac{1}{B} + {\langle A B \rangle}_2 \frac{1}{B}
[/tex]

(of course one could use the grade operator exclusively for vectors too, but given how common the dot product is, that just obfuscates things).

Now, when Geometric Algebra for Physicists, in equation (4.56) introduces the following notation for the symmetric sum of products:

[tex]
A * B = \langle AB \rangle
[/tex]

I don't see the point of introducing a second notation for grade zero selection.  We already have a special notation for that:

[tex]
A \cdot B = \langle AB \rangle.
[/tex]

If one is going to introduce an operator to complement the commutator product, then something like the following would make more sense to me:

[tex]
A * B = \frac{1}{2}\left(AB + BA\right)
[/tex]

For bivectors this selects all the 0,4 grade terms, whereas the commutator selects only the grade two term.  For trivector products the symmetric product above selects
the grade 0,4 terms, and the commutator would select the grade 2,6 terms (this general alternation pattern is what I initially described very badly as even and odd).

So my conclusion is that this is a typo in the text, but not in the errata.  I can't find any use of the notation past it's introduction.
