- In nfcmCh2.tex

   Turn the problems into \makeproblem form, and probably move elsewhere (somewhere appropriate by 
   context).

- 
   manual use of : \langle \rangle -> \gpgradezero
   manual use of \left( ... \right) -> \lr{}

- chapters should be flattened.

- There were some TODO's initially in the Changelog ... anything there still relavant?

- index the following (and perhaps more) in calculus/stokesTheoremGeometricAlgebra.tex:

bivector, blade, boundary, clifford algebra, curvilinear coordinates, cyclic, divergence, divergence theorem, dual, dual basis, Euclidean space, four form, four volume, geometric algebra, grade selection, gradient, Greenâ€™s Theorem, inner product, Minkowski space, one form, oriented area, oriented integral, oriented volume, outer product, parameterization, projection, pseudoscalar, reciprocal basis, reciprocal vectors, scalar selection, stokes theorem, tangent space, three form, trivector, two form, vector derivative, wedge product

- index other stuff in this collection.
   - create index first?

- post v.12 and increment version.

- have some example box overflows in stokes chapter.  Perhaps convert to subsections.

- undef: these should be path:gabook:
