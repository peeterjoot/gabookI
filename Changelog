v.13: To be posted.

- Fixed dead url in this bib entry:

   \citep{SpenceTensors}

- Fix up web references in bibliography to include 'accessed on...' references.  

  Fixing this will include modifying METADATA (for all books) so that the references are to my new
  peeterjoot.com/ URLs, and also including 'accessed-on' to those generated bib entries.  Those should be
  when METADATA was run to generate the .bib file.

- removed:

   \citep{SpenceTensors}

   The link included is dead.

v.12: a82c74d4f3b3ba11f2877b152a863b9928c8beac

This version mostly has various bits of maintainance to the latex code,
many of which were scripted.

5fcc8f6156dec7b4b4479a1212b5e5d09590e04d

   - Run filter:

     perl -p -i ~/bin/bracePurgeRef 

      >> had some older code that used (\eqnref) and (\cite).  Strip out the braces (leave the formatting to the ref and cite macros used, and change those globally if desired).

   - generate the \myTime command used in FrontBackmatter/Titleback.tex, FrontBackmatter/Titlepage.tex

     (changed: make.rules & ~/bin/mkRevInfo)

   - remove all Stokes theorem related content, pending a complete rewrite (in progress).

      \include{calculus/vectorIntegralRelations}
      \include{calculus/stokesRevisited}
      \include{calculus/stokesGradeTwo}
      \include{calculus/stokesNoTensor}

   - changes to the implementation of definition, theorem, lemma, and example environments (much prettier boxed backgrounds.)

   - Replace many

      \begin{align*}
      \end{align*}

   or

      \begin{align}
      \end{align}

   or

      \[
      \]

   with

      \begin{equation}\label{eqn:XX:n}
      \begin{aligned}
      ...
      \end{aligned}
      \end{equation}

   or
      \begin{equation}\label{eqn:XX:n}
      ...
      \end{equation}

   - Replace \hbar with \Hbar:

      \newcommand{\Hbar}[0]{\,\hbar}

   (some package is redefining hbar so that it appears typeset to close)

   - use \eqnref instead of \ref

   - spelling: indexes -> indices

   - move figures to ../../figures/gabook/

     (new submodule)

   - replace text 'figure \ref' with \cref

   - replace text 'equation \ref' with \eqnref.  Equation \ref -> \Eqnref

   - Add appendix chapter 'Mathematica notebooks'

   - replace \boxed{} and \myBoxed{} with \boxedEquation{}

   - replace \myMathWithDescription -> \mathLabelBox

   - prune some old RCS log file content.

   - use \prod instead of \Pi

   - split make.vars into make.bookvars and cleanup makefile accordingly.

   - some introduction of \lr{} insteaad of \left( \right)

   - use macros_bm.sty

   - introduce use of \qedmarker instead of \quad\square

   - total rewrite of Stokes theorem content, grouping into new chapter.

   - added \index markup: the new stokes chapter is indexed, and \chapter and \section headings.

DEFECTS (Scott)

- Section 3.2.9.  gaWiki.tex.  Reworked this section slightly based on Scott's feedback.  Include a diagram, then post in blog, email him for comment, and update ga_wiki.pdf on site.  Perhaps address the two other comments below first.
 
- Section 3.2.11. It seems more natural to reverse the order of the things shown in this section. i.e. show that y(dot)u^v=0, then do the planar projection.
 
- Page 43, you say that multiplication by e_1 on the right of a vector is called the conjugate, this might be true I don't have any reference for the conventions of vector multiplication by e_1. But, in this situation the quantity that you are multiplying is a complex number not a vector. It seems that it should read, 'multiplication on the right of a complex number is called the conjugate'.

- read of the pdflatex option:

pdflatex --job-name=dog cat.tex

to rename.  Try that in the makefile.

- shorten titles.

- probably other stuff that could also be moved (or removed for that matter).

- some of my topic pages had discussion bits that might be nice to incorporate
  as chapter heading pages.

	>> Have now done this for my 2009 descriptive text, and all but the e&m ones of the others.

- gaGradeDotWedge should logically be merged with the other intro page.  Til
  this is attempted leave them both.

  believe the original goal of both was to prove

  a . ( b ^ c ) = a . b c - a . c b

  and I don't think that I did so with either!

- preface material:

Fixup or comment out if not done before next publish.
