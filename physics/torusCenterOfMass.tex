\section{Motivation}

In \href{http://samjshah.com/2010/05/05/i-love-when-kids-stump-me/}{I love when kids stump me}, the center of mass of a toroidal segment is desired, and the simpler problem of a circular ring segment is considered.

Let us try the solid torus problem for fun using the geometric algebra toolbox.  

\input{physics/torusCenterOfMassParameterization.tex}

\section{Center of mass}

With the prep done, we are ready to move on to the original problem.  Given a toroidal segment over angle \(\theta \in [-\Delta \theta/2, \Delta \theta/2]\), then the volume of that segment is

\begin{align}\label{eqn:torusCenterOfMass:9}
\Delta V = r^2 R \pi \Delta \theta.
\end{align}

Our center of mass position vector is then located at

\begin{align}\label{eqn:torusCenterOfMass:10}
\BR \Delta V
&=
\int_{\rho=0}^r \int_{\theta=-\Delta \theta/2}^{\Delta \theta/2} \int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}
e^{-j\theta/2} \left( \rho \Be_1 e^{ i \phi } + R \Be_3 \right) e^{j \theta/2}
\rho \left( R + \rho \sin\phi \right) d\rho d\theta d\phi.
\end{align}

Evaluating the \(\phi\) integrals we loose the \(\int_0^{2\pi} e^{i\phi}\) and \(\int_0^{2\pi} \sin\phi\) terms and are left with \(\int_0^{2\pi} e^{i\phi} \sin\phi d\phi = i \pi /2\) and \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi = 2 \pi\).  This leaves us with

\begin{align}\label{eqn:torusCenterOfMass:11}
\BR \Delta V
&=
\int_{\rho=0}^r \int_{\theta=-\Delta \theta/2}^{\Delta \theta/2}
\left( e^{-j\theta/2} \rho^3 \Be_3 \frac{\pi}{2} e^{j \theta/2} + 2 \pi \rho R^2 \Be_3 e^{j \theta}  \right) d\rho d\theta \\
&=
\int_{\theta=-\Delta \theta/2}^{\Delta \theta/2}
\left( e^{-j\theta/2} r^4 \Be_3 \frac{\pi}{8} e^{j \theta/2} + 2\pi \inv{2} r^2 R^2 \Be_3 e^{j \theta}  \right) d\theta \\
&=
\int_{\theta=-\Delta \theta/2}^{\Delta \theta/2}
\left( e^{-j\theta/2} r^4 \Be_3 \frac{\pi}{8} e^{j \theta/2} + \pi r^2 R^2 \Be_3 e^{j \theta}  \right) d\theta.
\end{align}

Since \(\Be_3 j = -j \Be_3\), we have a conjugate commutation with the \(e^{-j \theta/2}\) for just

\begin{align}\label{eqn:torusCenterOfMass:12}
\BR \Delta V
&=
\pi r^2 \left( \frac{r^2}{8} + R^2 \right) \Be_3
\int_{\theta=-\Delta \theta/2}^{\Delta \theta/2}
e^{j \theta} d\theta \\
&=
\pi r^2 \left( \frac{r^2}{8} + R^2 \right) \Be_3
2 \sin(\Delta \theta/2).
\end{align}

A final reassembly, provides the desired final result for the center of mass vector

\begin{align}\label{eqn:torusCenterOfMass:13}
\BR &= \Be_3 \inv{R} \left( \frac{r^2}{8} + R^2 \right) \frac{\sin(\Delta \theta/2)}{ \Delta \theta/2 }.
\end{align}

Presuming no algebraic errors have been made, how about a couple of sanity checks to see if the correctness of this seems plausible.

We are pointing in the \(z\)-axis direction as expected by symmetry.  Good.  For \(\Delta \theta = 2 \pi\), our center of mass vector is at the origin.  Good, that is also what we expected.  If we let \(r \rightarrow 0\), and \(\Delta \theta \rightarrow 0\), we have \(\BR = R \Be_3\) as also expected for a tiny segment of ``wire'' at that position.  Also good.

\section{Center of mass for a circular wire segment}

As an additional check for the correctness of the result above, we should be able to compare with the center of mass of a circular wire segment, and get the same result in the limit \(r \rightarrow 0\).

For that we have

\begin{align}\label{eqn:torusCenterOfMass:14}
Z (R \Delta \theta) = \int_{\theta=-\Delta \theta/2}^{\Delta \theta/2} R i e^{-i\theta} R d\theta
\end{align}

So we have

\begin{align}\label{eqn:torusCenterOfMass:15}
Z
&= \inv{\Delta \theta} R i \inv{-i} (e^{-i\Delta \theta/2} - e^{i\Delta\theta/2}).
\end{align}

Observe that this is

\begin{align}\label{eqn:torusCenterOfMass:16}
Z &= R i \frac{\sin(\Delta\theta/2)}{\Delta\theta/2},
\end{align}

which is consistent with the previous calculation for the solid torus when we let that solid diameter shrink to zero.

In particular, for \(3/4\) of the torus, we have \(\Delta \theta = 2 \pi (3/4) = 3 \pi/2\), and

\begin{align}\label{eqn:torusCenterOfMass:17}
Z = R i \frac{4 \sin(3\pi/4)}{3 \pi} = R i \frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{3 \pi} \approx 0.3 R i.
\end{align}

We are a little bit up the imaginary axis as expected.

I had initially somehow thought I had been off by a factor of two compared to \href{http://samjshah.com/2010/05/05/i-love-when-kids-stump-me/#comment-2349}{the result by The Virtuosi}, without seeing a mistake in either.  But that now appears not to be the case, and I just screwed up plugging in the numbers.  Once again, I should go to my eight year old son when I have arithmetic problems, and restrict myself to just the calculus and algebra bits.
