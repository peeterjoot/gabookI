\makedefinition{Reverse}{dfn:reverse:1}{

Let \( A \) be a multivector with j vector factors, 
\( A = \Ba_1 \Ba_2 \cdots \Ba_j \),
not necessarily normal.  
The reverse \( A^\dagger \), or reversion, of this multivector \( A \) is
\begin{equation*}
A^\dagger = \Ba_j \Ba_{j-1} \cdots \Ba_1.
\end{equation*}

The reverse of a sum of multivectors is the sum of the reversions of its summands.
