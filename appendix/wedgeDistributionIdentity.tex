\maketheorem{Distribution of inner products}{thm:stokesTheoremGeometricAlgebra:1420}{
Given two blades \(A_s, B_r\) with grades subject to \(s > r > 0\), and a vector \(b\), the inner product distributes according to
\begin{equation*}
A_s \cdot \lr{ b \wedge B_r } = \lr{ A_s \cdot b } \cdot B_r.
\end{equation*}
}
